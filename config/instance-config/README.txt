This is config that is specific to a user, project, or deployed instance.

Typically this may be config files that contain samples/defaults from version control which the dev or a script will override/replace/substitute real values for.

e.g.
config.instance.webroot=/var/www/dev/oeh/may-demo
config.instance.emails=richardsj@manly.hydraulics.works
config.instance.log_level=debug
